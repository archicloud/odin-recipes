First project in Odin for a recipes website

Hello world, this is my attempt at Project Odin's first project. This is my first brush up with using Git. I will be highlighting important developments in this readme, kind of to serve as my journal repository progress. I'll be outlining my developments in in this readme file. By completing this project, I would have gained considerable skill in project inception, cloning, Git and HTML basics that would be paramount in my further lessons in CSS and Javascript

#1 - Succesfully clone Git repository into local machine and enable Git basics. This is my first attempt as I've created projects before with practically no lessons in git. 

#2 - Created basic HTML structure for a Recipe Website. Learning application is on the use of links, tags, lists and Git Basics. Filled in content for individual recipe links.
